This is a Figma plugin that allows to copy layers and paste
them at exactly the same position, no matter what layer was selected.
This is an attempt to implement the default behavior how
copy & paste works in Sketch, Photoshop, Adobe XD and etc.

How To Use:

Just use this plugin as you usually do when copy & paste layers, but with the
use the plugin's commands "Just Copy" and "Just Paste" from the menu or via
recommended shortcuts.

For example:
1. Select one or more layers on the canvas
2. Run the "Just Copy" command
3. Select a target layer next to which the copied layer should be pasted.
The plugin will use the first selected layer as the target if multiple
layers are selected.
4. Run the "Just Paste" command



Recommended shortcuts (MacOS)

- Copy: "⌃⌘C" (Control + Command + C)
- Paste: "⌃⌘V" (Control + Command + V)

Follow the instruction how to add the shortcuts using System Preferences if necessary: https://github.com/maxmartynov/figma-plugin-just-copy-paste#recommended-shortcuts-macos


Disclaimer:

There is no way for now to implement some of features to the full because of
some Figma's API limitations. But Figma's team is working on new features and
we will be able to get the plugin work like a charm soon.
